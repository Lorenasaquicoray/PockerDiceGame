# PockerDiceGame
This Python program evaluates dice rolls and assigns scores based on common poker-style hands (e.g., pairs, full house, straights). It reads dice inputs, checks for specific combinations, and calculates the total score over multiple rounds.

Key features:

Detects hands like one pair, two pair, full house, and straights.
Uses helper functions for tallying dice and checking multiples.
Ensures valid dice values (1-6) before scoring.
Run the program and input dice rolls to see your score after each round!
